<h3 class = "Subhead"> Wastewater Treatment Plant</h3>
<p class = "p1"> I took on this project during my third year of undergraduate program. I worked on this project for 2 semesters for the following outcomes.</p>
<!-- Lists are inspired from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp and edited for CSS. -->
<ul class = "p3">
	<li>Studying the amount of waste produced by factories in the dedicated area.</li>
	<li>Figuring out the methods for the treatment of this wastewater.</li>
	<li>Providing a plan for such a wastewater treatment plant.</li>
	<li>Creating a design that would redistribute the treated water back for recreation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "Subhead"> Design and Modelling of a Foldable Vault</h3>
<img src="Images/1.jpg" alt = "Vault">
<p class = "p1"> This was my final year project, where we undertook the task of designing and modelling a vault that could retract and expand at the push of a button and cover an area from weather effects.
<!-- <ul> creates an unordered list and each item in the list starts with the <li> tag. -->
<ul class = "p3">
	<li>Using AutoCAD to create a rough draft for how the design was going to be.</li>
	<li>Once the design was decided, using trigonometric formulae to calculate the length of each member.</li>
	<li>Calculating different types of loads that would be acting on the structure.</li>
	<li>With the determined member length and loads, creating a model in STAAD Pro with proper loading to stimulate a real-life structure.</li>
	<li>Analysis of said structure while following the Indian Standard rules for design for safety.</li>
	<li>This project ended up winning the award of the best project during our final year Open House competition.
</ul>
